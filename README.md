# Joshua Ferris

> Joshua Ferris's website. Built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and ðŸ’œ

## Features

- Donation processing. Using [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) I am able to take donations without ever having to handle credit card information.
- Static file serving. Able to share my resume and certifications easily.
- Blazingly fast. Thanks to the power of [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) I am serving a more typical website as it goes through their compiler before being served.
